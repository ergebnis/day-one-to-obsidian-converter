      "text": "Jessa and Aldo's wedding was, well, great. What else can you expect from two young people in love. It was wonderful to be with the family and celebrate with the young couple.\n\nI liked this table setting—fit well with their wedding theme and setting.\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/8215371F286A477993C602DEDC1B2FE7)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/0771BCBF1B4C497181556A4516174619)\n\nThe first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness; but happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb observing him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost, for he might often find it needful.\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/0915F4770B88420895837C8987662D75)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/6061BE33D7B240258503E7A9FE70B417)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/20EEA94213F346D1818FAF8AC0FCB861)\n\nNow upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip's seat. The involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack whale line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the water. That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line swiftly straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line, which had taken several turns around his chest and neck.\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/970DEE990F7341438D3A2289595D24F4)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/C17FC27B5EC74A508801C077FF44E86D)\n\nBut we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but this time he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale started to run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried traveller's trunk. Alas! Stubb was but too true to his word. It was a beautiful, bounteous, blue day; the spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like gold-beater's skin hammered out to the extremest. Bobbing up and down in that sea, Pip's ebon head showed like a head of cloves. No boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern. Stubb's inexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was winged. In three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and Stubb. Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his crisp, curling, black head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though the loftiest and the brightest.\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/22091B8213FE4E868A2165FC2F927225)",

Rather than the typical photos of people on a beach enjoying themselves in paradise, I thought, \"Why not some shots of a pineapple on a beach? No one does that.\" Now someone has. Bam.\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/5CB808A31A0E401BA5E82550FDE3F988)\n\nBut look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable, free-and-easy whaler! What does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in any sort of decent weather? She has a \"GAM,\" a thing so utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name even; and if by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it, and repeat gamesome stuff about \"spouters\" and \"blubber-boilers,\" and such like pretty exclamations. Why it is that all Merchant-seamen, and also all Pirates and Man-of-War's men, and Slave-ship sailors, cherish such a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a question it would be hard to answer. Because, in the case of pirates, say, I should like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it. It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed; but only at the gallows. And besides, when a man is elevated in that odd fashion, he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude. Hence, I conclude, that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman, in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on.\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/9AC29BB0F7894D3EA69B86FF05ECAC41)\n\nThe performance, so noisily announced by the Honourable Mr. Batulcar, was to commence at three o'clock, and soon the deafening instruments of a Japanese orchestra resounded at the door. Passepartout, though he had not been able to study or rehearse a part, was designated to lend the aid of his sturdy shoulders in the great exhibition of the \"human pyramid,\" executed by the Long Noses of the god Tingou. This \"great attraction\" was to close the performance.\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/B305B04C1DC741BEB560FFF9F00866E4)\n\n\"Then be careful that you don't repeat the impossible tale you told Sol-to-to just now—another world, indeed, where human beings rule!\" he concluded in fine scorn.\n\n\"But it is the truth,\" I insisted. \"From where else then did I come? I am not of Pellucidar. Anyone with half an eye could see that.\"\n\n\"It is your misfortune then,\" he remarked dryly, \"that you may not be judged by one with but half an eye.\"\n\n\"What will they do with me,\" I asked, \"if they do not have a mind to believe me?\"\n\n\"You may be sentenced to the arena, or go to the pits to be used in research work by the learned ones,\" he replied.\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/AB8063C594E84A64887C312FF175D615)",

      "text": "My favorite book\n## Moby Dick\n> Here be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale, continued through day into night, and through night into day, is a thing by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery. For such is the wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket commanders; that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried, they will, under certain given circumstances, pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time, while out of sight, as well as his probable rate of progression during that period. And, in these cases, somewhat as a pilot, when about losing sight of a coast, whose general trending he well knows, and which he desires shortly to return to again, but at some further point; like as this pilot stands by his compass, and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present visible, in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen headland, eventually to be visited: so does the fisherman, at his compass, with the whale; for after being chased, and diligently marked, through several hours of daylight, then, when night obscures the fish, the creature's future wake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter, as the pilot's coast is to him. So that to this hunter's wondrous skill, the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water, a wake, is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land. And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in its every pace, that, with watches in their hands, men time his rate as doctors that of a baby's pulse; and lightly say of it, the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot, at such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions when these Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep, according to the observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude. But to render this acuteness at all successful in the end, the wind and the sea must be the whaleman's allies; for of what present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is exactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his port? Inferable from these statements, are many collateral subtile matters touching the chase of whales.",

It didn’t turn out great, but you can see a hint of a cloud around the brightest stars there. Kinda cool!\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/BFD462BC2C91421CB9102EB00CC228EB)",

Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.\n\nShe stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.\n\nThe Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\n\n### The Question\n'Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.\n\n### The Answer\nThis was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, 'I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.'\n\n'What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly. 'Explain yourself!'\n\n'I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, 'because I'm not myself, you see.'\n\n'I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.\n\n### The Quandary \n'I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very politely, 'for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.'",

The family together warms the room and soul.\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/3B0512783BDC48C5867B18123171743B)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/C7D75D24A18A4C83B29069B39199520E)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/5209FCDB6C30440C89A0ADC8DFAB12C4)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/30B4E5D309DA411A9984FA3F429C2501)\n\nWe had a \"fun\" time getting the lights to stay on the house. :-)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/3FE582C6440946B288783220DD8FA7BA)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/6CAA74B1B1ED46C7A448870EC343F802)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/14B4E70FCD0D4161870557E70CF50B1F)\n\nIt was great to have Beth's family over with mine. Crowded... but great. It's weird how you look forward to the family together time, then get a bit stressed when all the kids start breaking things and thrashing the house, and then you start wishing they were home again. Then, a few hours after they leave, you're wishing they were back again.\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/91241A79BB7146118788E5386275593D)",

Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no room at all for any lesson-books!'\n\nAnd so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\n\n'Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the voice. 'Fetch me my gloves this moment!' Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\n\nPresently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself 'Then I'll go round and get in at the window.'\n\n'THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/A97172B1488140FEACAC57E4F6761966)",

      "text": "![](dayone-moment:\/\/79AEB93C3F7E404CB6E2F9B3C7BB43F5)\n\nDoes the all-contributed and all-receptive ocean alluringly spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable, taking terrors, and wonderful, new-life adventures; and from the hearts of infinite Pacifics, the thousand mermaids sing to them—\"Come hither, broken-hearted; here is another life without the guilt of intermediate death; here are wonders supernatural, without dying for them. Come hither! bury thyself in a life which, to your now equally abhorred and abhorring, landed world, is more oblivious than death. Come hither! put up THY gravestone, too, within the churchyard, and come hither, till we marry thee!\"\n\nAvailing himself of the mild, summer-cool weather that now reigned in these latitudes, and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuits shortly to be anticipated, Perth, the begrimed, blistered old blacksmith, had not removed his portable forge to the hold again, after concluding his contributory work for Ahab's leg, but still retained it on deck, fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast; being now almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen, and harpooneers, and bowsmen to do some little job for them; altering, or repairing, or new shaping their various weapons and boat furniture. Often he would be surrounded by an eager circle, all waiting to be served; holding boat-spades, pike-heads, harpoons, and lances, and jealously watching his every sooty movement, as he toiled. Nevertheless, this old man's was a patient hammer wielded by a patient arm. No murmur, no impatience, no petulance did come from him. Silent, slow, and solemn; bowing over still further his chronically broken back, he toiled away, as if toil were life itself, and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his heart. And so it was.—Most miserable!\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/527443155E1A4F959821EC33CB0FFB92)\n\nA peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful appearing yawing in his gait, had at an early period of the voyage excited the curiosity of the mariners. And to the importunity of their persisted questionings he had finally given in; and so it came to pass that every one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate.\n\nBelated, and not innocently, one bitter winter's midnight, on the road running between two country towns, the blacksmith half-stupidly felt the deadly numbness stealing over him, and sought refuge in a leaning, dilapidated barn. The issue was, the loss of the extremities of both feet. Out of this revelation, part by part, at last came out the four acts of the gladness, and the one long, and as yet uncatastrophied fifth act of the grief of his life's drama.\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/D9773BBFE4DA484F86C5D09DFD55B7FC)\n\nHe was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly encountered that thing in sorrow's technicals called ruin. He had been an artisan of famed excellence, and with plenty to do; owned a house and garden; embraced a youthful, daughter-like, loving wife, and three blithe, ruddy children; every Sunday went to a cheerful-looking church, planted in a grove. But one night, under cover of darkness, and further concealed in a most cunning disguisement, a desperate burglar slid into his happy home, and robbed them all of everything. And darker yet to tell, the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his family's heart. It was the Bottle Conjuror! Upon the opening of that fatal cork, forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up his home. Now, for prudent, most wise, and economic reasons, the blacksmith's shop was in the basement of his dwelling, but with a separate entrance to it; so that always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no unhappy nervousness, but with vigorous pleasure, to the stout ringing of her young-armed old husband's hammer; whose reverberations, muffled by passing through the floors and walls, came up to her, not unsweetly, in her nursery; and so, to stout Labor's iron lullaby, the blacksmith's infants were rocked to slumber.\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/F346369B39534BFCBDB366F7F7EFCFAD)\n\nOh, woe on woe! Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely? Hadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon him, then had the young widow had a delicious grief, and her orphans a truly venerable, legendary sire to dream of in their after years; and all of them a care-killing competency. But Death plucked down some virtuous elder brother, on whose whistling daily toil solely hung the responsibilities of some other family, and left the worse than useless old man standing, till the hideous rot of life should make him easier to harvest.\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/00F826E84CA54E55A542FBF022B22C34)\n\nWhy tell the whole? The blows of the basement hammer every day grew more and more between; and each blow every day grew fainter than the last; the wife sat frozen at the window, with tearless eyes, glitteringly gazing into the weeping faces of her children; the bellows fell; the forge choked up with cinders; the house was sold; the mother dived down into the long church-yard grass; her children twice followed her thither; and the houseless, familyless old man staggered off a vagabond in crape; his every woe unreverenced; his grey head a scorn to flaxen curls!\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/6483BE2E1FAA4ADAABC6AD419FDCB799)\n\nsthehjatjlsjfkdl;safjkldj\nfdshjafdkls;folk;dsjklf;dasjkfld;sjfjfkda;slid\nshfjkdlsa;jffjkdlsa;fjkdsl;am\n\n\nFaulk;fdjskal;fdjsklfmndksal;fjkdsla;DJ\n\nfjdklsa;fjkdsl;ajkfl;",

They’re just kinda funny-looking creatures, you know?\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/40CDD60774F643CBB71F95837905390F)\n\nBy the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: 'but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, 'as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.' So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend.\n\nWhen she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\n\nThe moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said.\n\nThe executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin at HIS time of life.\n\nThe King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.\n\nThe Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)\n\nAlice could think of nothing else to say but 'It belongs to the Duchess: you'd better ask HER about it.'",

Who are you, and why do you seek me?\"\n> \n> And the Lion answered, \"I am a Cowardly Lion, afraid of everything. I came to you to beg that you give me courage, so that in reality I may become the King of Beasts, as men call me.\"\n\"Why should I give you courage?\" demanded Oz.\n> \n> “Because of all Wizards you are the greatest, and alone have power to grant my request,\" answered the Lion.\n> \n> The Ball of Fire burned fiercely for a time, and the voice said, \"Bring me proof that the Wicked Witch is dead, and that moment I will give you courage. But as long as the Witch lives, you must remain a coward.\"\n> \n> The Lion was angry at this speech, but could say nothing in reply, and while he stood silently gazing at the Ball of Fire it became so furiously hot that he turned tail and rushed from the room. He was glad to find his friends waiting for him, and told them of his terrible interview with the Wizard.\n\nWow. I wonder what I would do if confronted with a Ball of Fire like that.",

      "text": "Sola and I had entered a building upon the front of the city, in fact, the same one in which I had had my encounter with the apes, and, wishing to see what had caused the sudden retreat, I mounted to an upper floor and peered from the window out over the valley and the hills beyond; and there I saw the cause of their sudden scurrying to cover. A huge craft, long, low, and gray-painted, swung slowly over the crest of the nearest hill. Following it came another, and another, and another, until twenty of them, swinging low above the ground, sailed slowly and majestically toward us.\n\nEach carried a strange banner swung from stem to stern above the upper works, and upon the prow of each was painted some odd device that gleamed in the sunlight and showed plainly even at the distance at which we were from the vessels. I could see figures crowding the forward decks and upper works of the air craft. Whether they had discovered us or simply were looking at the deserted city I could not say, but in any event they received a rude reception, for suddenly and without warning the green Martian warriors fired a terrific volley from the windows of the buildings facing the little valley across which the great ships were so peacefully advancing.\n\nInstantly the scene changed as by magic; the foremost vessel swung broadside toward us, and bringing her guns into play returned our fire, at the same time moving parallel to our front for a short distance and then turning back with the evident intention of completing a great circle which would bring her up to position once more opposite our firing line; the other vessels followed in her wake, each one opening upon us as she swung into position. \n\nOur own fire never diminished, and I doubt if twenty-five per cent of our shots went wild. It had never been given me to see such deadly accuracy of aim, and it seemed as though a little figure on one of the craft dropped at the explosion of each bullet, while the banners and upper works dissolved in spurts of flame as the irresistible projectiles of our warriors mowed through them.\n\nThe fire from the vessels was most ineffectual, owing, as I afterward learned, to the unexpected suddenness of the first volley, which caught the ship's crews entirely unprepared and the sighting apparatus of the guns unprotected from the deadly aim of our warriors.\nIt seems that each green warrior has certain objective points for his fire under relatively identical circumstances of warfare. For example, a proportion of them, always the best marksmen, direct their fire entirely upon the wireless finding and sighting apparatus of the big guns of an attacking naval force; another detail attends to the smaller guns in the same way; others pick off the gunners; still others the officers; while certain other quotas concentrate their attention upon the other members of the crew, upon the upper works, and upon the steering gear and propellers.\n\nTwenty minutes after the first volley the great fleet swung trailing off in the direction from which it had first appeared. Several of the craft were limping perceptibly, and seemed but barely under the control of their depleted crews. Their fire had ceased entirely and all their energies seemed focused upon escape. Our warriors then rushed up to the roofs of the buildings which we occupied and followed the retreating armada with a continuous fusillade of deadly fire.\n\nOne by one, however, the ships managed to dip below the crests of the outlying hills until only one barely moving craft was in sight. This had received the brunt of our fire and seemed to be entirely unmanned, as not a moving figure was visible upon her decks. Slowly she swung from her course, circling back toward us in an erratic and pitiful manner. Instantly the warriors ceased firing, for it was quite apparent that the vessel was entirely helpless, and, far from being in a position to inflict harm upon us, she could not even control herself sufficiently to escape.\n\nAs she neared the city the warriors rushed out upon the plain to meet her, but it was evident that she still was too high for them to hope to reach her decks. From my vantage point in the window I could see the bodies of her crew strewn about, although I could not make out what manner of creatures they might be. Not a sign of life was manifest upon her as she drifted slowly with the light breeze in a southeasterly direction.",

The South is the country of the Quadlings.\" \"I am told,\" said the third man, \"that it is the same at the West.  And that country, where the Winkies live, is ruled by the Wicked Witch of the West, who would make you her slave if you passed her way.\" \"The North is my home,\" said the old lady, \"and at its edge is the same great desert that surrounds this Land of Oz.  I'm afraid, my dear, you will have to live with us.\" Dorothy began to sob at this, for she felt lonely among all these strange people.  Her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted Munchkins, for they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep also.  As for the little old woman, she took off her cap and balanced the point on the end of her nose, while she counted \"One, two, three\" in a solemn voice.  At once the cap changed to a slate, on which was written in big, white chalk marks: \"LET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS\" The little old woman took the slate from her nose, and having read the words on it, asked, \"Is your name Dorothy, my dear?\" \"Yes,\" answered the child, looking up and drying her tears. \"Then you must go to the City of Emeralds.  Perhaps Oz will help you.\" \"Where is this city?\" asked Dorothy. \"It is exactly in the center of the country, and is ruled by Oz, the Great Wizard I told you of.\" \"Is he a good man?\" inquired the girl anxiously. \"He is a good Wizard.  Whether he is a man or not I cannot tell, for I have never seen him.\" \"How can I get there?\" asked Dorothy. \"You must walk.  It is a long journey, through a country that is sometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible.  However, I will use all the magic arts I know of to keep you from harm.\" \"Won't you go with me?\" pleaded the girl, who had begun to look upon the little old woman as her only friend. \"No, I cannot do that,\" she replied, \"but I will give you my kiss, and no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch of the North.\" She came close to Dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead.  Where her lips touched the girl they left a round, shining mark, as Dorothy found out soon after. \"The road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick,\" said the Witch, \"so you cannot miss it.  When you get to Oz do not be afraid of him, but tell your story and ask him to help you.  Good-bye, my dear.\" The three Munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey, after which they walked away",

Aouda remained in the car, as pale as death\\.\n\nThe door of the next car opened, and Colonel Proctor appeared on the platform, attended by a Yankee of his own stamp as his second\\. But just as the combatants were about to step from the train, the conductor hurried up, and shouted, \"You can't get off, gentlemen\\!\"\n\n\"Why not?\" asked the colonel\\.\n\n\"We are twenty minutes late, and we shall not stop\\.\"\n\n\"But I am going to fight a duel with this gentleman\\.\"\n\n\"I am sorry,\" said the conductor; \"but we shall be off at once\\. There's the bell ringing now\\.\"\n\nThe train started\\.\n\n\"I'm really very sorry, gentlemen,\" said the conductor\\. \"Under any other circumstances I should have been happy to oblige you\\. But, after all, as you have not had time to fight here, why not fight as we go along?\"\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/89F6B99AF96F4681A246394BA8C4B986)",

During our flight from Phutra I had restrung my bow with a piece of heavy gut taken from a huge tiger which Ghak and I had worried and finally dispatched with arrows, spear, and sword\\.  The hard wood of the bow was extremely tough and this, with the strength and elasticity of my new string, gave me unwonted confidence in my weapon\\.\n\nNever had I greater need of steady nerves than then—never were my nerves and muscles under better control\\. I sighted as carefully and deliberately as though at a straw target\\. The Sagoth had never before seen a bow and arrow, but of a sudden it must have swept over his dull intellect that the thing I held toward him was some sort of engine of destruction, for he too came to a halt, simultaneously swinging his hatchet for a throw\\. It is one of the many methods in which they employ this weapon, and the accuracy of aim which they achieve, even under the most unfavorable circumstances, is little short of miraculous\\.\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/ECAE9E05BEDC4C6C9F2F4BBDB55B7D64)\n\n\nMy shaft was drawn back its full length—my eye had centered its sharp point upon the left breast of my adversary; and then he launched his hatchet and I released my arrow\\. At the instant that our missiles flew I leaped to one side, but the Sagoth sprang forward to follow up his attack with a spear thrust\\. I felt the swish of the hatchet at it grazed my head, and at the same instant my shaft pierced the Sagoth's savage heart, and with a single groan he lunged almost at my feet—stone dead\\. Close behind him were two more—fifty yards perhaps—but the distance gave me time to snatch up the dead guardsman's shield, for the close call his hatchet had just given me had borne in upon me the urgent need I had for one\\. Those which I had purloined at Phutra we had not been able to bring along because their size precluded our concealing them within the skins of the Mahars which had brought us safely from the city\\.\n\nWith the shield slipped well up on my left arm I let fly with another arrow, which brought down a second Sagoth, and then as his fellow's hatchet sped toward me I caught it upon the shield, and fitted another shaft for him; but he did not wait to receive it\\. Instead, he turned and retreated toward the main body of gorilla\\-men\\. Evidently he had seen enough of me for the moment\\.\nOnce more I took up my flight, nor were the Sagoths apparently overanxious to press their pursuit so closely as before\\. Unmolested I reached the top of the canyon where I found a sheer drop of two or three hundred feet to the bottom of a rocky chasm; but on the left a narrow ledge rounded the shoulder of the overhanging cliff\\. Along this I advanced, and at a sudden turning, a few yards beyond the canyon's end, the path widened, and at my left I saw the opening to a large cave\\. Before, the ledge continued until it passed from sight about another projecting buttress of the mountain\\.\nHere, I felt, I could defy an army, for but a single foeman could advance upon me at a time, nor could he know that I was awaiting him until he came full upon me around the corner of the turn\\. About me lay scattered stones crumbled from the cliff above\\. They were of various sizes and shapes, but enough were of handy dimensions for use as ammunition in lieu of my precious arrows\\. Gathering a number of stones into a little pile beside the mouth of the cave I waited the advance of the Sagoths\\.\n\nTesting something\\. Testing it once more\\. ",

Those which I had purloined at Phutra we had not been able to bring along because their size precluded our concealing them within the skins of the Mahars which had brought us safely from the city.\\n\\nWith the shield slipped well up on my left arm I let fly with another arrow, which brought down a second Sagoth, and then as his fellow's hatchet sped toward me I caught it upon the shield, and fitted another shaft for him; but he did not wait to receive it. Instead, he turned and retreated toward the main body of gorilla-men. Evidently he had seen enough of me for the moment.\\nOnce more I took up my flight, nor were the Sagoths apparently overanxious to press their pursuit so closely as before. Unmolested I reached the top of the canyon where I found a sheer drop of two or three hundred feet to the bottom of a rocky chasm; but on the left a narrow ledge rounded the shoulder of the overhanging cliff. Along this I advanced, and at a sudden turning, a few yards beyond the canyon's end, the path widened, and at my left I saw the opening to a large cave. Before, the ledge continued until it passed from sight about another projecting buttress of the mountain.\\nHere, I felt, I could defy an army, for but a single foeman could advance upon me at a time, nor could he know that I was awaiting him until he came full upon me around the corner of the turn. About me lay scattered stones crumbled from the cliff above. They were of various sizes and shapes, but enough were of handy dimensions for use as ammunition in lieu of my precious arrows. Gathering a number of stones into a little pile beside the mouth of the cave I waited the advance of the Sagoths.\\n\\nTesting something. Testing it once more. \\n\"}]}",
